            Dentistry ( English : Dentistry ), also known as Oral Medicine , is a branch of medicine consists of a study
            and diagnosis and prevention and treatment of diseases and disorders and cases of oral cavity, usually in
            the teeth (evolution and arrangement of teeth ) as well as the oral mucosa and fittings and adjacent
            associated tissue Especially in the maxillofacial area. field of dentistry includes in addition to other
            aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular,
            lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures. The practitioner is called a dentist .
            <br>
            Dentistry is often understood to include the largely defunct medical specialty of oral medicine (the study
            of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) which is why the two terms are used interchangeably in certain
            areas. For example, in Australia , oral medicine is a specialty of dentistry. However, some specialties such
            as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction) may require degrees in medicine and dentistry to
            achieve. Dentistry and some branches of medicine in European history have been considered to stem from the
            barber surgeons trade . However, both fields have since developed with greater emphasis in the life sciences
            , evidence-based research and evidence- based practice .
            <br>
            Dental treatments are performed by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental assistants
            (dentist assistants, dental hygienists , dental technicians as well as dental therapists ). Most dentists
            work either in private clinics ( primary health care ), dental hospitals, or (secondary care) institutions (
            prisons , military bases, etc.).
            <br>
            The history of dentistry is as old as the history of mankind and civilization, with the oldest evidence
            dating back to between 7000 BC and 5500 BC. show the remains of the skeletons of Mehrgarh (now in Pakistan )
            , dated to that time evidence of dental tools drilling flint to remove decay , which is the way they found
            "surprisingly effective." Dentistry is believed to be the first medical specialty that developed its degree
            with its own specialties. modern evidence-based dentistry movement advocates the use of high-quality
            scientific research and evidence to guide decision-making such as dental preservation .Manually, use of
            water treatment fluoride and toothpaste with fluoride, dealing with oral diseases such as dental caries and
            periodontal disease age , as well as regular diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes and diseases of
            digestive disorders and cancer and HIV / AIDS AIDS , which can also affect the cavity the mouth.
            <br>
            Other practices related to evidence-based dentistry include oral radiographs to check for tooth deformity or
            oral infections, hematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery ,
            cardiology (due to various serious complications from dental surgery for heart patients), etc.

        <p>
            The term dentistry comes from dentist , which is derived from the French and Latin word for tooth. The term
            dental science and its diseases is also used to refer to scientific studies related to teeth ( Greek : ὀδούς
            ) meaning tooth, which is the study of the structure, development and distortions of teeth

    <h4 id="Dental Treatment">. Dental Treatment</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Dentistry usually includes procedures related to the oral cavity. Oral diseases are also considered, according
        to the World Health Organization , among the main common public health problems due to their wide spread around
        the world and their many infections.
        <br>
        Most dental treatments are done to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases, which are dental caries
        (tooth decay) and periodontal diseases ( gum disease and periodontitis ). Common treatments include dental
        restorations , extraction and surgical extraction, removal of sediment limestone and Otakecar and scrape the
        root and cleaning of periodontal pockets and root canal treatment endodontic , and cosmetic dentistry .
        <br>
        The duration of the study of dentistry is usually not less than 4 years, and the period varies according to the
        country and the educational system, for example, all dentists in the United States of America pass at least
        three years of university study, and almost all of them succeed in obtaining a bachelor’s degree. This
        educational attainment is followed by four years of study in the College of Dentistry to qualify him as a Doctor
        of Dental Surgery (DDS) or a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD). In Egyptian universities, the study period is 5
        years, in addition to a sixth year, which is the year of excellence, where the doctor passes through all dental
        departments to practice the largest number of cases. Depending on the nature of their general training, they can
        perform most dental treatments such as restorative treatments (restoration, crowns and bridges ), prosthetic
        treatments (movable devices), andCores processors and processors supporting tissue ( gum ) and take off the
        teeth and perform tests and radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis . Dentists may also prescribe medications such as
        antibiotics , analgesics, or other medications used in patient management.
        <br>
        There are specialties in dentistry such as restorative dentistry, fixed and removable prosthodontics, oral and
        maxillofacial surgery, oral medicine, periodontology, pediatric dentistry, orthodontics and radiation dentistry.
        <br>
        Dentists also encourage the prevention of oral disease through controlled oral hygiene and regular twice-yearly
        medical examinations for professional assessment and cleaning. Oral infections and infections may affect the
        general health of the individual, and some signs may appear in the oral cavity that are indicative of systemic
        diseases such as osteoporosis , diabetes , gastrointestinal diseases or cancer .
        <br>
        Several studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with a higher risk of diabetes, heart disease and
        premature birth. The concept of the possibility of the impact of oral health on systemic health and disease is
        expressed as "oral-systemic health".

        Dr. John M. Harris established the world's first dental school in Bainbridge, Ohio and helped establish
        dentistry as a health profession. The school was opened on February 21, 1828 and is today a Sunni museum.
        <br>
        The first dental college was Baltimore College of Dental Surgery Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in
        Baltimore, Maryland, US Baltimore, Maryland in the United States of America in 1840. The second college of
        dentistry in the United States of America was Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery, which was It was founded
        in 1852. In 1907 Templ University accepted a financial bid to incorporate the college.
        <br>
        Studies have shown that dentists who graduated from different countries and even from different dental colleges
        in the same country may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical situation.
        <br>
        In the United Kingdom the British Dentists Act 1878 and the Register of Dentists 1879 established that the title
        of dentist and dental surgeon be granted to registered and qualified practitioners only but that others may
        legally describe themselves as dental experts or dental consultants. The practice of dentistry in the UK is now
        fully regulated thanks to the Dentists Act 1921 which mandated membership registration for anyone practicing
        dentistry. The British Dental Association, which was formed in 1880 and headed by Sir John Toms, played a major
        role in prosecuting dentists who practiced illegally. Dentists in the UK are now regulated by the General Dental
        Council.
        <br>
        In Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, USA and Canada a dentist is a healthcare professional
        qualified to practice postgraduate dentistry with a DDS Doctor in Dental Surgery or a DMD Doctor of Dental
        Medicine These are equivalent to the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae (BDS, BDent,
        BChD, BDSc) degree awarded in the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. In most countries to
        become a qualified dentist one usually has to complete at least four years of university study and within the
        European Union the duration of education is at least five years. Dentists usually do five to eight years of
        undergraduate education and undergraduate and postgraduate training before practicing the profession.

    <h4 id="Specializations">. Specializations</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Some dentists conduct additional training after obtaining their first degree for the purpose of specialization.
        The specializations recognized by the Sunni registration bodies differ from one place to another, and according
        to countries and universities. Examples of specializations:

    <h4 id="History of dentistry">. History of dentistry</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The rate of dental caries was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the growth in agricultural societies about
        10,000 years ago led to an increase in dental caries.
        <br>
        The oldest recorded dental practice between 13,820 and 14,160 years old was found in Italy for a tooth that had
        been cleaned with flint stones . Although there is a study in 2017 indicates that human primitive (Neanderthal)
        has been used primitive dental tools. Evidence of dental practice was also found in the Indus civilization 7000
        BC. Researchers have found a place in Mehrgarh that is believed to have been intended to treat dental diseases
        with primitive tools such as drill brackets, and it appears that this was done by skilled craftsmen. These
        ancient tools of antiquity were simulated and turned out to be effective and convenient tools. The oldest dental
        filling process is 6500 years old in Slovenia and was used beeswax. The practice of dentistry in Malta has been
        proven in prehistoric timesThrough a skull dating back to 2500 BC an abscess of the root of a tooth had been
        excised .
        <br>
        A Sumerian text dating back to 5000 BC described the mouth worm as a cause of tooth decay. Evidence for this
        belief was also found in: Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese history. The legend of the mouth worm was
        mentioned in the writings of Homer. In the late fourteenth century, the surgeon (Guy de Chauliac) believed that
        worms were a cause of tooth decay.
        <br>
        Prescriptions for the treatment of dental pain and inflammation are spread in the Lahun papyrus, the Ebers
        papyrus , the Brogosh papyrus, and the Horst papyrus in ancient Egypt . In the Edwin Smith Papyrus, written in
        the seventeenth century BC but believed to reflect experiences dating back to 3,000 BC, treatment methods for
        jaw fractures are discussed . In the eighteenth century BC, the Code of Hammurabi - the constitution of laws
        during the reign of the sixth king of the ancient kingdom of Babylon - referred to tooth extraction twice in the
        context of punishments. Examinations of the remains of the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks also revealed their
        attempts in the field of prosthodontics. There is a possibility that this type of attempt was applied to the
        deceased to appear better.
        <br>
        Several Greek scholars such as Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote about dentistry. As they mentioned the method of
        tooth eruption and the treatment of its decay, and tooth extraction by means of clamps and connecting teeth to
        each other using wires to fix loose teeth, as well as gum diseases and jaw fractures. Some trace the first use
        of dental appliances and dental bridges to the Etruscans (inhabitants of Italy) 700 BC. In ancient Egypt,
        Hessi-Ra was the first person to be named a "dentist" in history. The Egyptians knew that the teeth were tied
        together with gold wires. The Roman medical writer Cornelius Celsus wrote extensively on dental diseases and
        their treatments, such as on anesthesia and vasopressors . The first dental filling process was documented
        withDental amalgam with a medical text of the ruling dynasty of China called ( Tang ) written by the Chinese
        physician (Su Kong) in 659 AD and it was presented in Germany in 1528 AD.
        <br>
        Among the Muslim scholars we mention ( Abu Bakr al-Razi ) (932 AD), who spoke about the anatomy of the jaws and
        teeth in detail, as well as the great surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi, who designed and drew many surgical tools
        that approximate their accuracy to the current tools, and Ibn Sina spoke in his famous book The Canon of
        Medicine about the treatment of Jaw fractures and the necessity of splinting the fractured pieces in their
        correct position, as evidenced by occluding the teeth in place from the dental arch. Then it came Abulcasis
        wrote a book drainageHe talked about dental surgery, explaining and pictures of swabs for cleaning teeth from
        calculus, as well as explaining and depicting clasps (plural of clamps) for tooth extraction, mentioning the
        process of making bridges to stabilize weak teeth, and also mentioning the process of sawing teeth and
        interlacing molars and teeth with threads of gold and silver and found machines to cut excess flesh from the
        gums, and mentioned complications caused by dental disease and came to mention fistulas oral associated with
        dental pests disease was recommended Labaki fistulas Bmkkawi with capital commensurate capacity with the
        capacity of the lumen fistula and wrote about the crowbar as a tool for tooth extraction and warned of leaving
        the roots and talked about fractions of jaws and take off TMJ and lip rabbit tumor Aldvdei
        <br>
        Historically, tooth extraction was used as a treatment for some diseases. In the Middle Ages , dentistry was not
        an independent profession during the nineteenth century, but was practiced by general practitioners and barbers
        . And the role of barbers was limited to tooth extraction operations to relieve the pain caused by chronic
        inflammation of the tooth. The tools used in tooth extraction are extensions of machines used in previous
        centuries. In the fourteenth century, Guy de Chauliac invented a swan-like device for extracting teeth, and this
        device was used until the late eighteenth century . Then it was replaced by the so-called (tooth key). In the
        twentieth century it was replaced by modern dogs.
        <br>
        The first dental book to focus solely on dentistry was Artzney Buchlein, written in 1530. The first dental book
        written in English was Operator for the Teeth (literally: a dental therapist) written by Charles Allen in 1685.
        <br>
        In the United Kingdom, there were no specific qualifications for those who wanted to provide dental treatment
        until 1859. In 1921, training and familiarity with the field was made a condition for its practice. In 1979 the
        Royal Commission Health issued a report stating that registered dentists per 10,000 inhabitants were more than
        double the number in 1921.

        <hr>
        <p>
            Modern dentistry originated between 1650 and 1800. The French physician Pierre Fauchard was called the
            father of modern dentistry. He was a skilled surgeon who, despite the limitations of primitive surgical
            tools in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, was able to significantly develop dental tools by modifying
            the tools of watchmakers, jewelers and even barbers, which were believed to be useful in dentist. Insert
            dental fillings as a treatment for dental holes. He also emphasized that acids derived from sugars such as
            tartaric acid are responsible for dental caries, and pointed out that tumors surrounding the teeth and gums
            may appear in late stages of dental caries.
            <br>
            Fauchard was a pioneer of prosthodontics, and he pioneered many ways to replace missing teeth. He said that
            the replacement teeth can be made of blocks of ivory or bone. Fauchard introduced dental braces - although
            they were of gold - he discovered that the position of the teeth could be corrected given that the teeth
            followed the shape of the wires. Fasten the brackets with waxed linen or silk threads. Fauchard's
            contributions to dental science lie in his book published in 1728 entitled The Surgeon Dentist. The French
            text included the anatomy and functions of the mouth, dental structures, various techniques for healing and
            dental surgery, and in this book a practical chapter between dentistry and surgery in its general sense.
            <br>
            The study of dentistry expanded rapidly after Fauchard. The British surgeon John Hunter wrote two important
            books: The Natural History of Human Teeth (1771) and (A Practical Study of Oral Diseases (1778). And he
            began to theorize the possibility of transferring teeth from one person to another, and said that the
            chances of success of the dental transfer process rise when the tooth is transferred as quickly as possible
            and is in size with the recipient person. These principles are still used in internal organ transplants.
            Hunter has already performed several pioneering operations in which he has attempted to transfer teeth from
            one person to another. Although the donated teeth did not adhere well to the recipient's gums, one of
            Hunter's patients said that 3 of the teeth that Hunter transferred to him held for 6 years, which is
            considered an important achievement in that period.
            <br>
            The tremendous advance in dentistry was in the nineteenth century when dentistry transformed from a trade
            into a profession. The dental profession was subject to government regulatory laws at the end of the
