            Cancer ( English : Cancer ) is a group of diseases characterized by cells proliferation and penetrated (the growth and
            division cell is limited), these cells divided have the ability to invade tissues adjacent and destroy, or move to
            distant tissues in a process called metastasis . These abilities are characteristics of a malignant tumor in contrast to
            a benign tumor , which is characterized by a specific growth and inability to invade or metastasize. However, a benign
            tumor can sometimes develop into a malignant cancer. About 5-10% of cancers are caused by genetic defectsIt is inherited
            from a person's parents and cancer can be detected with certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. After that, more
            tests are done by medical imaging and confirmation by taking a biopsy .
            <br>
            Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally , and is responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018.
            Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is
            due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive alcohol consumption. Other factors include certain
            infections, exposure to radiation, and environmental pollutants. In the developing world, 15% of cancers are caused by
            infections such as Helicobacter pylori , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , human papillomavirus , Epstein-Barr virus , and
            HIV.. These factors work, at least in part, by altering a cell's genes. Therefore, many cancers can be prevented by not
            smoking , maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains,
            vaccinating against some infectious diseases , not eating a lot of processed and red meat and avoiding intense exposure
            to the sun.
            <br>
            The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer , and stomach cancer . In
            females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer , and cervical cancer . If skin cancers
            other than melanoma were included in the total new cancer cases each year, that would be about 40% of cases. In
            children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors areMore common, except in Africa where non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
            occurs more often. In 2012, about 165,000 children under the age of 15 were diagnosed with cancer. Cancer can affect all
            ages when human even fetuses , but the risk of infection increases with the more progress of human age. Cancer causes
            death in 13% of all deaths .
            <br>
            Early detection by screening is useful in cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are
            controversial. Cancer is often treated with a combination of radiotherapy, surgery , chemotherapy, and targeted therapy
            . Managing pain and symptoms is an important part of care. Palliative care is especially important for people with
            advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and the extent of the disease at the start of
            treatment. At diagnosis in children under 15 years of age, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on
            average 80%. For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66%.

        Cancer is a large group of diseases that consist of abnormal growth of cells with the potential to invade or spread to
        other parts of the body. These cells form a group of tumors. A tumor is a group of cells that have undergone
        disorganized growth and will often form a mass, but with the possibility of diffuse distribution.
        <br>
        All cancer cells show the six features of cancer. These properties are required for the production of metastasis.
        <br>
        Cells grow and divide abnormally from appropriate signals
        Constant growth and division, even with contradictory signals
        Avoid programmed cell death
        An infinite number of cell divisions
        Promote the building of blood vessels
        Tissue invasion and metastasis formation
        The evolution from normal cells to cells that can form a mass that can cause cancer involves multiple steps known as
        malignant progression.

    <h2 id="Cancer symptoms">Cancer symptoms</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        hen cancer begins, it does not produce any symptoms. Signs and symptoms appear as a lump or sore grows, and what appears
        may indicate the type and location of the cancer. There are few specific symptoms and it can be difficult to diagnose
        cancer.
        <br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="Reasons">Reasons</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Most cancers, about 90-95% of cases, are due to genetic mutations caused by environmental and lifestyle factors. The
        remaining 5-10% is due to heredity . Environment refers to any cause that is not genetic, such as lifestyle, economic
        and behavioral factors, and not just pollution. Common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include
        tobacco (25-30%), diet and obesity (30-35%), infection (15-20%), radiation (ionizing and non-ionizing, up to 10%), lack
        of Physical activity and pollution. Psychological stress does not appear to be a risk factor for cancer, although it may
        exacerbate outcomes in people who already have cancer.
        <br>
        It is not generally possible to establish the cause of a particular cancer because different causes do not have definite
        hallmarks. For example, if a person who uses tobacco develops lung cancer significantly, it is likely caused by tobacco
        use, but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation, the
        cancer may have developed for one of those reasons . With the exception of the rare transmissible cases that occur with
        pregnancies and occasional organ donors, cancer is generally not a transmissible disease.

        <p>
            Most cancers are initially recognized either by signs or symptoms or by screening. Neither of these leads to a definitive
            diagnosis, which requires examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist . People suspected of having cancer are
            investigated through medical tests. These tests usually include blood tests, x-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or
            endoscopy .
            <br>
            Tissue diagnosis from biopsy indicates the type of cell that is proliferating, its histological grade, genetic
            abnormalities and other characteristics. This information is useful for evaluating the prognosis and choosing the best
            treatment.
            <br>
            Cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry are other types of tissue tests. These tests provide information about molecular
            changes (such as mutations, fusion genes, numerical chromosomal changes) and thus may also indicate the diagnosis and
            the best treatment.

    <h4>Nomenclature</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Tumor : Any abnormal growth or enlargement, or the appearance of a strange mass in the body. Tumor is considered a
        synonym for the word agenesis. And the formation can be solid and produce a tumor, or non-solid - such as leukemia -
        does not produce tumors. Progenitor cells are of two types:
        Arise/malignant tumor : which is what is meant by cancer.
        Adenoma/benign tumor : It is a growth characterized by limited growth and proliferation, non-invasive, and not
        characterized by metastasis.
        Invasive tumor : This term is another synonym for the word cancer. Where it refers to the invasion of cancer cells to
        the tissues surrounding the cancer.
        Possible malignant tumor , precancerous tumor , and non-invasive tumor : they are synonymous with non-invasive neoplasms
        , but there is a high probability of their transformation into malignant neoplasms if left untreated. Localized
        carcinoma.
        Surgical edges : This is the pathologist's evaluation of the edges of the resected tumor, to determine if the tumor has
        been completely removed (negative edges) or if a portion remains unremoved (positive edges).
        Tumor grade : a number (usually from 1 to 3) given by a pathologist to describe the degree of similarity between
        cancerous cells and healthy cells surrounding the cancer.
        Tumor stage : a number (usually from 1 to 4) given by a pathologist to describe the degree of cancer invasion of the
        human body.
        Recurrence : These are new tumors that appear in the same location as the first tumor.
        Metastases : These are new tumors that appear in places far from the first tumor.
        Transformation : The transformation of a low-grade tumor into a high-grade tumor within a certain time.
        Prognosis : The probability of recovery after treatment. It is often measured by the probability of surviving more than
        five years as a minimum after diagnosis.

            Cancers are classified based on the similarity between a cancerous cell and a healthy cell. Examples of types of cancer:
            <br>
            Carcinoma : These are cancers that stem from the epithelial tissue and constitute the largest group of cancers in
            general, especially in breast, prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer.
            Sarcomas : These are cancers that stem from connective tissue (ie, bone, cartilage, fat, and nerves).
            Lymphoma and leukemia : two cancers that stem from blood-forming cells.
            Sex cell tumors: They are tumors that usually occur within the gonads ( ovary and testis ).
            Glioblastoma : A tumor that resembles immature tissue or embryonic tissue and is more common in children.

        Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. Globally,
        about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer.
        <br>
        About 70% of cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. About a third of cancer deaths are attributable to
        the five major behavioral and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical
        activity, tobacco use and alcohol use. Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for cancer and is responsible for
        about 22% of cancer deaths.
        <br>
        Cancers that cause infections, such as hepatitis and human papillomavirus, are responsible for 25% of cancer cases in
        low- and middle-income countries. Late presentations and inaccessible diagnosis and treatment are common. In 2017, only
        26% of low-income countries reported having pathology services generally available in the public sector. More than 90%
        of high-income countries report that treatment services are available, compared to less than 30% of low-income
        countries. The economic impact of cancer is large and growing. The total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was
        estimated at US$1.16 trillion. Only 1 in 5 low- and middle-income countries have the data to drive cancer policy.
