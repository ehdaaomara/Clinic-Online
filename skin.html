        <p>
            The skin is the organ that covers the human body and the bodies of many other animals. main function of the skin in
            humans is to protect the body and is one of the first lines of defense against germs, and the skin protects the body
            through its physical properties, as it is almost completely resistant to wetness, and prevents the permeation of fluids
            that submerge the tissues of the body. The skin is the largest organ in the human body.
            <br>
            And the skin prevents bacteria and chemicals from entering most parts of the body, and protects the tissues that lie
            beneath it from the harmful rays of the sun.
            <br>
            In addition, the skin helps maintain the internal temperature of the body at normal levels, by making the glands in the
            skin secrete sweat when a person is exposed to intense heat, as the sweat evaporates, cooling the body; But when the
            cold is severe, the body retains heat by narrowing the blood vessels in the skin, and as a result, the blood flow to the
            surface of the body decreases, and thus the body loses less heat.
            <br>
            In the skin, there are many nerve endings that are sensitive to cold and heat, as well as the nerve endings of pain,
            pressure and touch.
            <br>
            The skin is the largest organ in the human body. If we spread the skin of a male human weighing 6-8 kg, it would cover
            an area of about two square metres.
            <br>
            The skin, in anatomy , is the protective outer covering of the body . The skin is the largest organ in the human body .
            The skin consists of 3 main layers:
            <br>
            Epidermis : the outer layer of the skin. This layer contains the melanin cells responsible for skin color
            Dermis : The dermis under the epidermis contains nerve endings, sweat and sebaceous glands, blood vessels and lymph.

        </div>
        <p>
            The skin is characterized by the presence of three layers of tissue:
            <br>
            skin.
            dermis
            Subcutaneous tissue or (adipose tissue).
            The epidermis, which is the outer surface layer, is the thickness of a sheet, and the skin covers most parts of the
            body. The thickness of the dermis, which is the middle layer, is about 15-40 times the thickness of the epidermis.
            <br>
            As for the subcutaneous tissue, which is the inner layer, it varies greatly in thickness among individuals, but in all
            people it is much thicker than both the epidermis and the dermis. In addition to these tissues, the skin includes hair,
            nails, and certain types of glands.
            <br>

        <div class="img">
            <img src="imgs/skin color.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
            Skin color varies greatly between peoples and individuals. The color of the skin depends mainly on the amount of brown
            pigment melanin produced by the skin, and melanin is formed by the cells that produce it in the skin. People of all
            nations are equal in the number of these cells, but the melanin-producing cells in people with dark skin produce more
            melanin than in people with light skin, and the amount of melanin produced in each person depends mainly on heredity.
            However, exposure to sunlight increases melanin production and leads to lighter skin pigmentation. In some cases,
            melanin forms and collects in small spots, forming freckles, most of which appear on the face and hands, and exposure to
            sunlight may lead to an increase in freckles.
            <br>
            With age, melanin-producing cells produce it in an irregular way, so that some areas of the skin remain light while
            others become dark. These dark spots are sometimes called age spots (pyramid) or liver spots. The skin also becomes
            thinner and drier with increasing age. Therefore, the skin begins to wrinkle and becomes covered with scales or scales.
            In addition, the skin of an elderly person is injured, bruised and cracked with unusual ease, and it heals and heals
            very slowly.

    <h4 id="Skin disorders">Skin disorders</h4>

    <p>
        Skin infections; The most common skin infection is eczema, in which the skin reddens and provokes the urge to itch, and
        the skin may be covered with small scales or leaking liquid from it. And hypersensitivity eczema is a common disease in
        children and appears in most cases on the face, back of the neck, knees or inner sides of the arms. Contact dermatitis
        is a type of allergy to certain substances that a person touches. Many people, for example, develop a rash after being
        stabbed with nettles, and after prolonged use and contact with some chemicals such as acids, dyes, and some types of
        soap and medicines, or after wearing some types of shoes or underwear made of synthetic fibers. Or when dealing with
        hard building materials such as cement.
        <br>
        infection A skin infection is caused by a type of bacteria, fungi, parasites, or virus. Some of these organisms invade
        the body by penetrating the skin and others remain on the surface of the skin. Some types of infections, such as boils
        and impetigo, are caused by bacteria. Boils are painful red bumps filled with pus. Impetigo, which mainly affects
        children, leads to the appearance of thin blisters on the skin, which crack or burst and the skin becomes scaly or
        covered with scales.
        <br>
        Fungi cause diseases such as ringworm (ringworm) and athlete's foot. Ringworm is a general name for many types of fungal
        infections, the common type of which is characterized by the appearance of areas of red, ring-shaped spots with thin
        scales. As for athlete's foot, it is a type of ringworm in which cracks form in the skin between the toes.
        <br>
        Parasites that infect the skin include lice and scabies mites. Lice invade the hair of the scalp and other parts of the
        body, while the scabies mite burrows and hides under the surface of the skin. And both are contagious and lead to
        itching or itching.
        <br>
        Viruses cause cold sores and herpes zoster, as well as other types of diseases. Cold sores are blisters that usually
        appear around the mouth. Herpes zoster is painful blisters that first appear on the chest and lower back.
        <br>
        burns; Burns are caused by heat from a fire or other source, some chemicals, electric shock, or excessive exposure to
        sunlight. Doctors divide burns into three degrees: first-degree burns, second-degree burns, and third-degree burns.
        First-degree burns lead to redness of the skin, and they only affect the skin, and they heal without leaving a scar or
        residual trace. Second-degree burns cause blisters and ulcers in the skin because they affect the epidermis and part of
        the dermis, and therefore, they leave slight scars. Third-degree burns cause severe blisters or blackening of the skin.
        Because it destroys all three layers of skin, some victims resort to surgery to remove dead tissue and repair the skin.
        The surgeon may perform a skin graft in which healthy skin replaces the burned tissue. See: skin grafting.
        <br>
        The sunburn may be simple or severe. Minor burns lead to redness of the skin, which disappears after a few days. Severe
        burns lead to blisters and ulcers in the skin, and may be accompanied by chills, dizziness and fever. Repeated exposure
        to sunburn for a long time may contribute to severe wrinkles and skin cancer.
        <br>
        Sunburn can be avoided by using reflective or sun-blocking paints that block the burning rays, or by gradual exposure to
        the sun, which leads to skin pigmentation; However, repeatedly dyeing the skin in this way may also contribute to the
        formation of wrinkles and skin cancer.
        <br>
        neoplasms; Abnormal cell growth, which may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancerous and do not spread in
        the body, while malignant tumors are cancerous and can invade the surrounding tissues and spread to distant places in
        the body through the circulatory system, and this process is called metastasis.
        <br>
        Benign skin tumors include lipomas, moles, and warts. A lipoma is a large, soft mass of fat under the surface of the
        skin. A mole is a group of colored cells that are flat or raised spots on the skin and are mostly black or brown. As for
        warts caused by viruses, they can appear anywhere on the skin, and most of them are raised from the surface of the skin
        and are rough, dry and do not cause pain. However, plantar warts that grow on the bottom surface of the feet sometimes
        press on some nerve endings in the dermis and are painful.
        <br>
        Malignant skin tumors include: basal cell epithelium, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The most common malignant
        cutaneous neoplasm is basal cell epithelium, which begins as a small, pinkish bump or lump that slowly enlarges. This
        type invades and destroys the healthy tissue around it, but it does not move.
        <br>
        Squamous cell carcinoma begins as an enlargement of the skin or a bump and swelling that erodes to form an ulcer with a
        crust, and this type of cancer metastasizes in some cases.
        <br>
        As for melanoma, it is the most dangerous type of skin cancer because it often moves from one place to another in the
        body with the formation of metastases. A red area, brown spots or a white ring may appear around the mole, and the tumor
        may be flat or raised from the surface of the skin and vary in size and color. In most cases, the patient can be cured
        and cured if the diagnosis and treatment is done in the early stages. Although most skin tumors are harmless, any
        unusual growth should be seen by a doctor immediately.
        <br>
        Other skin disorders. These include acne, corns, urticaria, psoriasis, and scleroderma.
        <br>
        Acne mostly affects adolescents, and it consists of blackheads and other pimples that appear mainly on the face, upper
        chest and back. A corn is a painful enlargement of the skin of the foot, most of which results from pressure or friction
        from uncomfortable shoes.
        <br>
        Hives are small white or red spots as a reaction or allergy to certain foods or medicines. Psoriasis is characterized by
        thick, red, raised patches of skin covered with silvery-white scales. Scleroderma is a hardening and swelling of the
        thickness of the skin, especially the skin of the hands and fingers, caused by an increase in the secretion of collagen,
        a protein found in the connective tissues, and painful sores may appear in the affected parts.

        The skin is the body's first line of defense against microbes and external factors.
        The fatty layer in the skin acts as a heat insulator, and the sweat glands maintains the body temperature from rising
        above normal body temperature by secreting sweat .
        It is believed that the sebaceous glands have anti-bacterial properties.
        It also contains nerve receptors for sensations of heat, cold, pressure and touch.
        The skin plays a key role in the formation of vitamin D , as vitamin D is formed from exposure of the skin to the
        ultraviolet rays of the sun,
        The secretion of melanin in the skin protects the skin from ultraviolet rays and reduces the risk of skin cancer
        It is the first wall of protection from viruses in the body.

            ry skin : It is characterized by a tight appearance, narrow pores, a rough texture, and a tendency to wrinkle. This type
            of skin that has little secretion of sebaceous glands dries quickly and easily and is very sensitive to weather changes.
            Oily skin : It is thick and shiny, secreting a lot of fat and resisting weather changes better, but it is prone to
            pimples and pimples
            <br>
            Normal skin : it is soft and flexible and does not pose any special problems. It is usually somewhat greasy on the chin
            and the base of the nose, where the sebaceous glands are concentrated and less fat on the cheeks and temples.
            It may appear on the human body, especially the skin, as the claws of an animal or the like. This is what is known as
            the claw invasion of the skin. This disease has been discovered recently,,, and it is more common in adolescents than it
            is in the elderly.
